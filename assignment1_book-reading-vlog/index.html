        <p><br>Freshly graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design, Veridian Sterling is ready to hang her work in any of the countless New York galleries that are sure to give her a show. The problem is only one will, and they’re not interested in her art so much as her personal assistant skills.
            <br><br>
            No glitz, no glam, and definitely none of the money she needs to help her struggling mother finally realize her dream of starting her own business after having sacrificed everything for Veri to go to art school. So when she overhears her new boss discussing the impressive finder’s fee for a lost Van Gogh, Veri takes matters into her own hands. Maybe her own artwork isn’t celebrated, but she knows how to copy what is, and maybe those skills can help lead to a discovery.
            <br><br>
            But when a famous art dealer takes her under his wing (and his charming driver takes her interest), Veri realizes she’s in deeper than she expected, and quite possibly with the wrong people. With her mother’s dreams and her own future at stake, Veri will have to pull out every trick she can think of to wipe her canvas clean and erase the mess she’s created before she goes down for someone else’s crimes.</p>

    <br>I just finished binging the complete TV series of White Collar before accepting this book for review, and I was still on my art heist kick. I love art so much. I was an art history minor in undergrad, and I love books dealing with art and artists and art lovers. Veridian Sterling Fakes It sounded like THE perfect book for me and I thought for sure I was going to love it! Unfortunately, it didn’t work out for me the way I had hoped. As always, my main points are bolded.
    <br><b>1.</b> First of all, I don’t think book knows what genre it’s supposed to be.
    <br><b>2.</b> The events in this book are a series of convenient coincidences that had nothing to do with the characters written.
    <br><b>3.</b> These characters are all extremely unlikable.
    <br><b>4.</b> Are the stakes in the room with us? 
    <br><b>5.</b> I did love the glimpses of life in New York City -->

                <div class="text-box">
                It’s love at first haunting in a seaside town that raises <br> everyone’s spirits in this new series from Jen DeLuca. <br><br>
        
        Small Florida coastal towns often find themselves scrambling <br>for the tourism dollars that the Orlando theme parks leave behind. <br>And within the town limits of Boneyard Key, <br>the residents decided long ago to lean into its ghostliness. Nick Royer,<br> owner of the Hallowed Grounds coffee shop, embraces the ghost tourism that keeps <br>the local economy afloat, as well as his spectral roommate. At least <br> he doesn’t have to run air-conditioning. <br><br>
        
        Cassie Rutherford possibly overreacted to all her friends<br> getting married and having kids by leaving Orlando <br>and buying a flipped historic cottage in Boneyard Key. <br>Though there’s something unusual with her new home <br>(her laptop won’t charge in any outlets, and the poetry magnets on her fridge <br>definitely didn’t read “WRONG” and “MY HOUSE” when she put them up), <br>she’s charmed by the colorful history surrounding her.<br> And she’s catching a certain vibe <br>from the grumpy coffee shop owner whenever he slips her a free slice of <br>banana bread along with her coffee order.<br><br>
        As Nick takes her on a ghost tour,<br> sharing town gossip that tourists don’t get to hear,<br> and they spend nights side-by-side looking into the former <br>owners of her haunted cottage, their connection solidifies into <br>something very real and enticing. But Cassie’s worried she’s<br> in too deep with this whole (haunted) home ownership thing…and Nick’s <br>afraid to get too close in case Cassie gets scared away for good.<br><br>

                    A heartwarming story about a mother and daughter in wartime <br>England and the power of the books that bring them together<br><br>

In Nottingham, England, widow Emma Taylor finds herself in <br>desperate need of a job to provide for herself and her beloved <br>daughter, Olivia.

When the threat of war becomes a reality, Olivia must be evacuated<br> to the countryside. In her daughter’s absence, Emma seeks solace in<br> the unlikely friendships she forms with her neighbors and coworkers,<br> as well as the recommendations she provides to the library’s quirky <br>regulars.

As the Blitz intensifies in Nottingham and Emma fights to reunite <br> with her daughter, she must learn to depend on her community and <br>the power of literature more than ever to find hope in the <br>darkest of times. <br>
